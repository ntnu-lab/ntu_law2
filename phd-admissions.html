                <p><strong>A:Thesis Supervisor Application Requirements</strong><strong><br> </strong><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Students should register their thesis supervisor and the thesis title before the end of the second month in the second school year.
                    Students can only register for the degree examination at least one year after they have actually registered the thesis supervisor.<br> <strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Students’ thesis supervisors should be professors of NTU Law School, and
                    the thesis title should be the supervisor’s specialized or related area.&nbsp;<br> <strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Students who wish to engage adjunct professors as the thesis supervisor should at the same time engage full-time professors
                    to joint instruct as well. In rare cases when engaging an adjunct professor to instruct alone is necessary; the student should submit application form beforehand and state the reason. The application must be passed by the course committee.</p>

                <p><strong>G:</strong><strong>&nbsp;Submission of Dissertation Draft<br> </strong>Before Ph. D students start writing their dissertations, they should note that NTU Law School accepts dissertations written in foreign language, subject to
                    the approval of the Course Committee. An abstract written in Chinese should be submitted together with the dissertation on the oral defense if the dissertation is written in foreign language.&nbsp;<br> Before the semester that students
                    plan to graduate, Ph. D candidates must select “Dissertation (Ph. D.)” in the NTU Course selection system. PLEASE NOTE: students are required to study for at least four semesters in order to receive a doctoral degree, which means the
                    oral defense can only take place after the fourth semester of the study.&nbsp;<br> <strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Since 2005 academic year, applicant will also have to hand in two copies of the first draft of the dissertation approved by
                    the supervisor, together with the electronic file of an 5000 word abstract within five days once the semester starts.<br> <strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;A committee will be gathered to review the dissertation and the abstract, and decide
                    whether the Ph. D candidate is entitled to defend his/her dissertation. If the committee decides not to grant the qualification, the candidate has one chance to revise the dissertation draft in three months and hand it in for revision
                    again. If he/she still fails to pass the review for the second time, he/she won’t have another chance in the same semester, and will have to wait until the following semester.<br> <strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The choice of persons of committee
                    members for students enrolled before 2005 academic year will be suggested by NTU Law School course committee and engaged by chairman.</p>

The examination committee has to be composed of five to seven examiners, including the dissertation supervisor.
                    The list of members must be submitted to Office of College of Law and examined by the College within a month after the semester starts.&nbsp;(The thesis seminar must be before December 15th&nbsp;for the first term; before May 15th&nbsp;for
